/**
 * Created by xschen on 11/6/2017.
 * The Barabási–Albert (BA) model is an algorithm for generating random scale-free networks using a preferential attachment mechanism.
 * Several natural and human-made systems, including the Internet, the world wide web, citation networks, and some social networks are
 * thought to be approximately scale-free and certainly contain few nodes (called hubs) with unusually high degree as compared to the
 * other nodes of the network. The BA model tries to explain the existence of such nodes in real networks. The algorithm is named for
 * its inventors Albert-László Barabási and Réka Albert and is a special case of a more general model called Price's model
